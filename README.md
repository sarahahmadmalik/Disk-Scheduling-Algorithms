# Disk Scheduling Algorithms for Operating Systems

This React project implements several disk scheduling algorithms commonly used in operating systems, including First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF), SCAN, and CSCAN.

## Project Overview

This project is built using Create React App and aims to visualize and compare the performance of various disk scheduling algorithms. Disk scheduling is a critical component of operating systems responsible for efficiently managing and optimizing the order in which read/write requests are processed on a disk.

## Technologies Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/): A simple yet flexible JavaScript charting library for designers and developers.
- [Material-UI](https://mui.com/): A popular React UI framework.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): JavaScript runtime used for building and running the application.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): Node.js package manager, typically installed with Node.js.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory using the terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to launch the application in development mode.
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view and interact with the app.

## Additional Scripts

- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production, optimizing the build for performance.
- `npm run eject`: Ejects the app from Create React App, providing full control over configurations.
